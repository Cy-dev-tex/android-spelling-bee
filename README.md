Android-Spelling-Bee-App
========================
This Spelling Bee App is designed to help students improve and practice their spelling skills. By using this application, users will be able to learn new words as well as evaluate their ability to spell words. This application does this by pronouncing words for the user while asking them to spell each word. Pictures associated with the words would also be displayed on the screen to assist the user. As the user progresses, they have the option to increase the difficulty of the words in which the length and obscurity of the words vary. The user is also given the opportunity to use hints if they are stuck. Hints can reveal the length of a word, or several letters of the word. Users may skip words as well. Sounds would be played after the user submits their spelling. For encouragement, this application provides a scoring system in which the user gain points for successfully spelling a word. The user would earn more points for spelling harder words. However, the amount of score earned would be minimized based on the amount of hints used, and the amount of time used to spell each word. The user can also enter a challenge state, in which they can see how many words they can spell within a time-limit. After the time-limit, statistics are displayed to show how well the user performed.
